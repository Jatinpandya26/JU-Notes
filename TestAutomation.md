# Test Automation

# Testing
* The process of analyzing a software item to detect the differences between existing and required conditions (that is bugs) and to evaluate the features of the SW items
* Testing is the process of evaluating a system or system components by manual or automated means to verify that it satisfies specified requirements, or to identify differences between expected and actual results
* Software testing can be stated as the process of validating and verifying that a software program/application/product:
    1. Meets the requirements that guided its design and development
    2. Works as expected
    3. Can be implemented with the same characteristics
    4. Satisfies the needs of stakeholders

## Why Testing
* A defect in software can cause harm to a person,to the environement or to a company
* Software that does not work correctly can lead to many problems, including loss of money,time or business reputation, and could even injury or death
* About 40% of the project cost goes to cost of quality
* A primary purpose of testing is to detect software failures so that defects may be discovered and corrected
* Testing helps to measure the quality of software in terms of defects found,for both functional and non-functional software requirements
* Software testing may also be required to meet contractual or legal requirements, or industry-specific standards

## Software Testing Life Cycle
1. Gathering Test Requirements
2. Test Planning -> Preparing the test strategy & planning
3. Test Analysis
4. Test Cases Design -> Creating the testing environment
5. Test Data Creation/Updating
6. Test Cases Execution -> Writing the test cases/Creating & Executing
7. Defect Tracking & Report Generation -> Analyze Bugs and application errors, Analyze result and Bug Report
8. Testing Signoff -> Formal go ahead from team on the defect free System move to Production

## Testing Levels
1. Functional
    * Unit Testing
    * Integration Testing
    * System Testing
    * Regression Testing
    * Acceptance Testing
2. Non Functional Testing
    * Performace Testing
    * Usability Testing
    * Securtiy Testing

## Testing Methods
* Static Testing -> Static Testing is a form of software testing where the software isn't actually used. It is primarily checking of the code and/or manually reviewing the code or document to find errors
(Probably finding error in Logic)

* Dynamic Testing -> Dynamic analysis refers to the examination of the physical response from the system to variables that are not constant and change with time
* In dynamic testing the software must actually be compiled and run. It involves working with the software,giving input values and checking if the output is as expected by executing specific ```test cases``` which can be done manually or with the use of an automated process
* Example: Black box and White Box Testing

## Criteria to Stop Testing
* Testing Deadlines
* Completion of test cases execution
* Completion of Functional and code coverage to a certain point
* Bug rate falls below a certain level and no high priority bugs are identified
* Management decision
