6. Best Practice and techniques


# Intro
* Bot insight -> analytics platform
* Rpa platform -> task and meta bot, meta bot is the advanced version of the task bot
* Cognitive platform-> IQ bot 

# RPA platform
* Rule based
* front end automation
* Multi system integration
* Structured Data

# Cognitive platform
* Algorith based decision
* self learning activity
* Vision,NLP
* Semi structured data
* Dark data ->semi structured(pdf,images) or unstructured , 80 % data is in this form
* IQ bots helps to work on semi structured or unstructred data
* ML and AI abilities are supported with IQ bots

# Analytics Platform
* Provides business insights
* measures effectiveness
* make scaling decisions
* how much should be invest to make sure revnue is being generated

# Able to automate
* reading data from certain platform and writing to another
* works both for web bases and desktop based
* works awesome with Structured Data and good with semi-structured
* rule based decisions

# lacks
* Not able to work with handwritten data
* non rule based general calls

# Notes
* Once bot is set up on control room then it can be used to all other machines connected with same control room
* There are 2 types of clint: 
  1. Development Client -> bot creators
  2. Runtime Client -> bot execution, required once the bot is deployed to control room
* v-10.5, 8GB of RAM is required, CLient only would require 4gb RAM
* current version-: 11.3.3
* Latest Version of AAE Client requires around 16GB RAM
* Control room is equipped with lots of tools and activities, its different in version 11 then 10
* AA community is applicable only for 1 month
* License in AA are customized thus can be developed based on requirements and charges will be applicable as per the needs
* To execute or use the Control Room , we require License to be uploaded on server through the control room application only
* Bots can be scheduled to be execute at certain time only
* autologin feature -> it allows the machine to unlock the software, login the client and do the automated tasks
* Ram usage can be found using variable ```RamUsage``` and CPU usage using ```CPUUsage```.
* ```Secured Recording``` ~> It is set disabled by default and can be set active from the control room,While its active no sensitive data is captured during the recording
* A BOT is developed to ```Shrink Deployment Time```, ```Reduced Operational Costs``` and ```Amplify ROI from RPA```


# Runtime Client
* It is classified into 2 catgories:
  1. Attended -> Requires human interaction
  2. Unattended -> no human interaction required
  
# Time to Create
* KeyStrokes -> insert data in some other application
* Select Window shows the list of all applications opened on your system
* to perform certain hotkey actions just choose options from given list
e.g [ENTER]
* the commands can be reordered by move up or move down option
* Open Program/Files -> to open application,just type its name
* To upload your bot to main control room , just right click on bot file and click upload
* Community edition software does not have access to control room(users can not be created, licenss can not be managed)
* ```atmx``` standard bot file extension
* Repository Manager -> it allows the control room admin to run or schedule the uploaded bots
* To create a user:
  1. Actions Tab
  2. Create User Tab
  3. Set the details and all details are editable
* Various Roles available
  1. Admin -> can never login to the client and make bot, License Allocation:None
  2. AnalyticsConsumer -> work on BotInsight platform, utilize the reports
  3. AnalyticsExpert -> work on BotInsight platform, process the reports
  4. Basic -> mandatory, as it allows to login , for both runner and developer client
  5. IQBotServices  -> Cognitive platform
  6. IQBotValidator -> Cognitive platform
* Automation Anywhere works on R back policy, custom bots can be created to restrict or determine the permissions allowed for a user
* Control Room Recognizes the ```BOTS``` based on their machine id
* Operation Room -> Shows the task that are currently in progress
* Audit Trail -> Its the log file which stores the data regarding each and every activity, success / failures , reasons etc.
* Roles and Permission -> These can be set in control room and custom roles can be created as well
* App Management -> To integrate the system with other applications
* Outgoing Mail Server Application -> to send mails with reference to working or progress of any bots can be set
* On Installation of Control Room , two categories or options are available:
  1. Express Mode -> the master key gets set with machine
  2. Manual Mode -> master key is need to be given at every login instance
* Secure Recording -> It is required to be ```enabled``` so that the recorder would not record snapshots and take only Abstract information
* Help / Support -> it can be customized as per the need

## To Set Auto Login
* Click on Tools
* Click Options
* In Login Settings
  * Set Username and Password
  * Check auto login and scheduler task
  * Finally Apply
 
## Workflow Designer
* Helps to maintain the libraries of the bots
* every workflow can have only single start button
* To Create a ```WorkFlow```
  1. Click on Workflow
  2. Click New Workflow
  3. Drag and Drop ```Start``` activity
  4. ```Run Task``` -> this activity selects the pre build bots or tasks
    * ```Repeat``` -> recursive action
    * ```speed``` -> the way to complete the task, in real time , at backend etc
    * ```Variable``` -> to set dynamic variables for our task such as login credentials
* Its a kind of UML Diagram which can be designed as well as executed at the same moment

## Properties
* ```View Logs``` -> this option is used to check the log file
* ```TimeOut``` -> any bot can be given a timeout after which even if the application wouldn't have completed execution, it will be terminated
* ```Notification``` -> once email settings are done, one can use it to send mails with email trigger
* ```HotKey``` -> shortcut can be set to run some bot

## SCHEDULE
* It can be used to schedule a particular bot and for it t, the machine password is mandatory to be specified

# Practical
# Recorders
* There are 3 types of Recorders:
  1. Smart Recorder
  2. Screen Recorder
  3. Web Recorder
  
## Smart Recorder
* It captures the coordinates
* It captures the image in background
* It captures the object
* Smart Recorder has the inherent ability to identify keystroke actions such as ‘Shift + A’ as capital A. Also, special keystrokes such as ‘Tab’ and ‘Enter’ are saved as separate actions in the command.
* Use Smart Recorder:
    1. To record tasks in Internet Explorer 8 and above only.
    2. To navigate across controls, it is recommended that you use 'Click' action instead of 'TAB'.




## Screen Recorder
* Captures mouse movements,clicks and keystrokes

## Web Recorder
* Based or made for internet related tasks, IE supportable 100% and only
* It provides encoding feature of different languages
* When a task is recorded using Web Recorder, if the layout of a web page changes and the web controls move to a different location on the page, Automation Anywhere is capable of locating the new position of these controls and running the task correctly.

# 3rd October
## DataBase
* Microsft Access -> Microsoft Jet 4.0 OLE DB Provider
* Connect -> this is command used to connect MS access with AA
* Prompt -> Used to prompt user to get an input for True/False or Yes/No which can be stored in a variable
* It has 4 types of commands:
  * Prompt for Value
  * Prompt for File
  * Promp for Folder
  * Prompt for Yes/No
* In prompt, there is option for ```Select Window``` in that use ```Don't write in Any Window``` to make sure what screen will be seen in background while prompt is there
* SQL Commands are not supposed to end with semi-column ```;```
* The input given by user is ```Generic``` by default

    


## Variable Manager
* Create custom variables
* Value Type -> start with 'v' letter for variable name
* Array Type -> start with 'arr' letter for array name
* List Type -> start with 'list' word for list name
* New variables can be created by just using the ```Add``` button

## Read From CSV/Text
* It is an activity which can be used to read data from CSV or Text File
* ```Delimeter``` -> used to differentiate data
* By default Read CSV file activity iterates over line by line
* ```$Counter$``` is an inbuilt function which can be used to iterate and show no of iterations done

## Error Handling
* Isolates errors that occur when running tasks
* To Continue the task even if some error occurs , it is used
* Various Error Handling Options are:
  1. Take Snapshot -> save a pic of error
  2. Run Task -> run any other task
  3. Log Data Into File -> create an log file for errors
  4. Send Email -> To send an email regarding the error
  5. Variable Assignment
  6. Set task status
  
* In error Handling ..if any task fails to accomplish, we can set it to do any of the above tasks
* There are 2 System Variables made to be used for error handling 
   * Error Description
   * Error Line Number
* <b>Variable Watch Table </b> -> it is used to check the variables changing if...```Dynamically```
* <b> Toggle Break Point </b> -> It is use to freeze the executing script and run a step of the process by self click only
* <b> Step Over </b> -> It is clicked to run the next step of process when the code is freezed
* Enabling ```Error Debugging``` mode gives you access to remove errors using its inbuilt features


## PDF Integration
* It allows you to copy text from pdf
* to merge or split two or more pdfs
* to encrypt or make pdf password protected and to decrypt as well

## Encryption
* It is of 2 types:
  1. Symmetric  -> same lock and unlock key
  2. Assymmetric -> differnt lock and unlock key
* In AA, we have 3 activities with us
  1. Encrypt Files -> easily set passphrase and encrypt with any given algorithm
  2. Decrypt Files
  3. Create keys
* Various Symmetric Algorithms available are:
  1. Idea
  2. TripleDES
  3. CAST5
  4. Blowfish
  5. AES128
  6. AES192
  7. AES256
  8. Twofish256
* ```Create keys``` is used to create the public and private keys 
* The file extension of keys should be ```.snk```
* The files Encrypted with ```Public keys``` can only be saved with ```Private Keys```

* PMM is an evolutionary improveent path. This path guides organizations as they move towards automated business processes
* Each stage of the PMM is a foundation for the next stage to build upon, and the improvement strategy frawn from a PMM provides a roadmap for continuous process improvement.
* It has 5 stages:
    1. Automation Pipeline ~> This stage helps in identifying and prioritizing processes eligible for automation and includes two phases.These are:
        * Top Level Benefit Analysis
        * Candidate prioritization
    2. Feasibility Analysis ~> This is analysis ad evaluation of a process in the automation pipeline to understand if it is technically feasible within a specific cost bracket
    3. Complexity Assessment ~> This assessment helps determine the effort required to develop and standardize an automated process
    4. ROI Analysis ~> Return-on-Investment analysis helps determine the returns that will be gained upon investing in Automation
    5. Automation Design ~> This is the stage during which process-specific and infrastructure-specific automation solutions are designed
* Each of these stages is an elimination round for processes.Those that do not satisfy the requirement of any of these stages get eliminated from the automation pipeline

# Control Room Settings
* A role-based accessibility model ensures each User views information or data relevant to the role assigned to the User by the Control Room Administrator
* Web CR acts as a centralized server that enables monitoring,deploying and scheduling of Bots anywhere, anytime
* Repository Path ~> It is the shared path of the Control Room repository where physical files are stored
* Client Service Port ~> It is the default port used to communicate with the Enterprise Client
* WebSocket Service Path ~> It indicates the location of the machine from where the WebSocket service is hosted
    click ```tool icon``` to open in edit mode and input the IP or the Hostname and the Port
* The CR Acess URL indicates the path to either the local IIS, the reverse proxy or the load balancer - whichever is used for your web environment
    click ```tool icon``` to open in edit mode and input the IP or the Hostname and the Port
* Outgoing Mail Server Configuration ~> used to send email notifications which can be updated using this command
* Credential Vault ~> To Configure the settings for the Credential VAult, A super admin has tp choose between Express or Manual Mode where
    Express Mode: Use this to auto-connect to the Creential Vault(master key will be stored)

# Tool and Commands 
## Read from CSV/Text
* Used to List sepearated or Tab delimited data
* Read multiple lines
* Encode data into ANSI,UNICODE or UTF8 Encryption format

## Variables
* There are 4 types of Variables
1. List ~> This holds multiple values in a single dimesnion. It is used for retrieving multiple values, or Sending email to multiple recipients or Passing different values inside of a loop or Searching multiple web addresses.
2. Array ~> This is a multi-dimensional variable that holds multiple values in a table of rows and column. Arrays are used for 
    1. Extracting data from web Pages
    2. Extracting multiple rows of data 
    3. Reading or writing data
    4. Filling out order forms
3. Value Variable ~> This is created when a user needs to hold a single value and use it in multiple places
4. Random Variable ~> This generate a random , repetitive or a numerical set. Generally used to create sample test data in form of String or Numerical

* ```AAControlRoom``` ~> System variable used to show the Control room URL
* Variable Manager can be used to Add,Edit,Delete or copy the variables
* ```Table Column``` System Variable Stores the Content from the table extracted through Web Recorders Extract Table Command
* ```List`` Loop is used to perform loop operation based on the selected variable

## Image Recognition
* The Comparison Mode allows 4 options:
    1. Advance(Default & Recommended) ~> Provides accurate results in cases where the screen resolution/zooming or application scaling is subject to change
    2. Normal Mode ~> Compares the RGB components of the pixels with the source
    3. Gray-Scaled mode ~> Converts pixels to an appropriate level of gray-scale prior to comparing
    4. Monochrome mode with Threshold ~> Converts pixels to either black or white prior to comparing
* Image Recognition command allows you to locate an image after the image might be moved, for example, from one location on a web page to another.
* It also allows you to use Image based automation when application UI elements may not be available for automation. For example, when application is exposed over Citrix or when application accessed from RDP, or when object detection is not as reliable such as legacy applications, you can use the Image Recognition command.

## Insert Work Item
* In order to use Work Item command, there are some criteria to be considered. These Include
    1. You need to have a Bot Creator license
    2. You need to have setup the Queue in the Control Room Workload page prior to using it in a Task Bot
    3. You must be added as a participant in a Queue or queues in the Control Room,otherwise, Not Enough Privileges error condition occurs.
* If the queue is in run mode and associated with a bot to prcess work items in the Queue, a ```STAGED``` error condition occurs.


## Error Handling
* The Error Handling command is used to handle errors while running a task and aids in debugging the task
* The Error View Tab in the Workbench can be used to manage errors
* It updates the changes automatically and Tracks and debygs longer tasks
* Error Handling Options are:
    1. Take Snapshot ~> Captures and saves a screenshot of the error screen as file in a default temp folder where file is timestamped with Day, Month, Year, Hour and Minute
    2. Run Task ~> Run another task , when the current task encounters an error
    3. Log Data into File ~> Logs the error data into a file
    4. Send Email ~> Send an email with Snapshot of Screen,Text file containing the value of all variables(user / system)
    5. Variable Assignment ~> Specifies a value to a particular variable and sets a Task Status, while you continue running a task
* By using the Error Handling commands, you can isolate errors that occur when running your TaskBot / MetaBot Logic.
* When an error occurs, you can continue the TaskBot / MetaBot Logic after the error, or stop the Taskbot / MetaBot Logic.


## Manage Web Control Commands
* The Manage Web Controls subcommand is located inside the Web Recorder command
* Web controls are objects on webpages that run when the page is requested and render markup to a browser
* It can be used to insert actions to the following:
    1. Links
    2. Drop Down menus
    3. Checkboxes
    4. Radio buttons
* It can be used to insert text or ```set values``` in Web based text fields same as ```Type Into command``` of UiPath


## Log To File Command
* A log file can be saved with ```.csv``` or ```.txt``` extension
* It provides encoding in the ```ANSI```,```UNICODE``` and ```UTF8``` format
* This command helps to 
    1. Verify that TaskBot or MetaBot logic runs properly
    2. Create a new log file if one does not already exist
    3. Specify custom text to be included in the file
    4. Add a timestamp to the file and
    5. Use the file as a variable


## IF/Else Command
1. Window Exists/Window does not exist ~> It checks or verifies that a specific application is open, checks whether an error has occurred and checks whether a file download has completed or not
2. Script Successful/Unsuccessful ~> Integrates third-party scripts(VB,JavaScript) with automation taskbot/metabot logic,Determines if the script ran successfully after the runs and issues a return code and it also integrates scripts with the automation TaskBot/MetaBot logic for scripts already developed
3. File Date ~> Checks the date and time that a file was created or last modified, Specifies a date range using ```between``` or ```before``` keywords and uses a number of days or a time schedule in the ```hh:mm:ss``` format.
4. Image Recognition ~> Checks whether an image exists within another image, Recognizes image stored in files or captured from a window when the TaskBot/Metabot Logic runs , It specifies a minimum ```percentage match``` for the image captured and It enables to perform click action on the captured image if found within larger image
5. Windows Control ~> Checks whether a specific control exists in an active window such as command buttons, list box items, text boxes or menu tabs


## Manage Windows Control Command
* Controls are UI elements that enable user interaction with an application
* Generally includes Buttons,Text-Boxes,ComboBoxes,List box items,Menu tabs, checkboxes and tables
* This command is useful in:
    1. Performing actions on the controls
    2. Assigning captured properties to variables and
    3. Recording actions that are performed simultaneously
* it can be used to 
    1. Get Name Text
    2. Get Value Text
    3. Click on Link
    4. Get Name of All Children
    5. Get Value of All Children
    6. Left Click

## Object Cloning command
* Used to capture an object,its co-ordinates and images from desktop and web-based application
* Capture objects within windows that use technologies such as Flex,Silverlight,Java and Html etc.
* ```Re-Capture Image``` ~> Used to recapture the image in case of any discrepancy in captured co-ordinates or image
* Select object in ```object``` mode and if it doesn't work then only go for ```coordinates``` or ```image``` mode.


## Insert KeyStrokes Command
* It supports German,French,Italian and Spanish language


# MetaBots
* Metabots are the Automation building blocks which are the Reusable application blueprints of an application
* Metabot is application resilient, which means anytime an application ```Updates``` or ```Changes```, the user can make minimal edits to the Bot itself and those changes will automatically be applied to any process
utilizing that bot
* The Automation blue prints can be constructed using the elements present in metabots such as
    1. Visual Captures ~> GUI components,screensof an application
    2. Application API's ~> which are interfaces that allow low level operations of an application by circumventing GUI(most common is DLL)
    3. Navigation Flows ~> Pre-configured use cases of an application and leverage visual captures and API's
* Benefits of MEtabots
    1. Accelerated automation ROI
    2. Eliminates navigational errors
    3. No live access requirement
    4. Easy calibration
* With Metabot Designer we can ```Create,Manage,Conceptualize bots``` and upload the metabots to the ```control room``` for use by other enterprise client users and edit metabots created by other users
* Visual Captures are referred as ```Screens```
* Screens and DLLs form the Assets using which you can define and pre-configure any use in case of a target application to create a navigational flow, known as Logic
* If Version Control is enabled for controlled edits of Metabots, a BotCreator can Check Out the MetaBot for editing and view Version History
* The MetaBot tab opens each MetaBot in its own tab. This tab is dedicated to the Assets and Logic for that particular MetaBot
* The Add Folders option organizes your MetaBot using ```Folders```.This enables you to easily manage all your screens and DLLs that are to be uploaded or have been uploaded
* Various Options that can be used in ```Asset``` view are:
    1. The ```Add Screen``` Option captures a single screen for an executable application, that is running
    2. If your Screens are set at lower resolutions such as ```1024x768``` , the ```Add Folder``` and ```Add Screen``` options can be accessed from the ```Edit``` menu
    3. The ```Record Screen``` option captures multiple screens of the related application or webpage at one go. And Every Screen or Menu Item or Pop-up or Context Menu that you interact with during the recording gets caotured
    4. The ```Add DLL``` option adds the ```Application Programming Interface``` or ```DLL``` within your MetaBot.Remember though, you cannot include ```special characters``` in DLL names
    5. The ```Configure```option edits properties for the ```recorded``` or ```added``` screens such as Name,Path,Value etc. Thus improving the reliability of your automation
    6. The ```Calibrate``` option instantly compares an existing screen with a newer screen of an application to identify any changes when the application has been updated with improvements and newer features
    7. The ```Delete``` option removes the MetaBots that are no longer required.
* If an application has multiple ```exe's```, you are required to create a separate MetaBot for each
* Various Options that can be used in ```Logic``` view are:
    1. The ```Add Folder``` option is similar to that under Assets. It organizes your Logic using ```Folders```
    2. The ```Add Logic``` option allows to create the ```navigational flows``` in the Logic Editor
    3. The ```Record Logic``` option records the logic flow and automatically saves ```Screens``` in Assets.
    4. The ```Edit``` option makes changes to an existing navigational flow
    5. The ```Delete``` option deletes the ```obsolete Logic```
* We Can use the ```MetaBot Workbench``` to create simple,manageable and independent naviagtional flow to be integrated into other automation TaskBots/MetaBot logics.
* BotCreator user with MetaBots Repository access permissions can create,record,upload and delete MetaBots
* Notes:
    1. MetaBots are highly re-usable; create once, use everywhere. They can be leveraged by any automation task.
    2. Enterprises can leverage MetaBot library to standardize org-wide automation in a rapid manner.
    3. MetaBots ensures systematic, accelerated automation ROI.
    4. MetaBots help to eliminate common navigational errors in complex automation tasks.
    5. MetaBots help to automate without requiring access to live application.
    6. MetaBots can be easily calibrated to newer versions of applications to ensure compatibility.
* Deleting a MetaBot from the MetaBot Designer doesn’t delete it from Control Room.

## Making an MetaBot
* On creating on ```New MetaBot```, New MetaBot Application opens and lists all applications currently opened in system and gives us two options for MetaBot Type
    1. Application Specific ~> Create automation using Screens from single application
    2. All Applications ~> Create automation using combination of Screens from different applications
* Click on ```Add Screen```, an Open Screens window opens that shows all instance of currently open screens of the selected application
* We have 2 methods to capture type for Screen Objects that are ```Standard``` and ```OCR```
* Select ```Standard``` when using technology such as ```MSAA,html``` etc
* Select ```OCR``` when capturing objects from application images which are exposed over applications such as ```Citrix``` or ```RDP```

# Terminal Emulation
* A Terminal is a device with a computer screen and a keyboard used to communicate with a minicomputer or mainframe computer
* A terminal emulator is an application that allows PC users to talk with mainframes as if they were using a terminal
* Automation Anywhere is an automation software that has a terminal emulator build into it
* You can use terminal emulation commands to perform various operatins,such as connect,send text,get text,set value and disconnect
* Terminal Model ~> It Enables you to connect to various Terminal Workstations and Displays such as IBM 3477,IBM 3278 and more as listed in the command UI
* Code Page ~> Enables you to set the encoding type such as German 273, Iceland 871 etc. for the Terminal

* Various Commands of Terminal Emulator are:

1. Connecting to a remote system
    * Using the Connect command, we cam remotely connect to a terminal.Terminals with which we can connect are:
    ```ANSI,VT100,TN3270,TN5250```
    * With SSL ~> ensures a secure connection for Terminal Types ```TN3270 and TN5250``` with the default port ```992```
    * Selecting ```Enable TN3270E Support``` allows you to choose a ```Connection Method```,which could be either ```Generic``` or ```Specific```
    * Generic ~> Input the Device Name
    * Specific ~> Input the Device Name and Resource LU Name (Only on enabling TN5250 Support
    

2. Sending Text
    Using the ```Send Text``` command,you can send text to the remote system,similar to how you send keystrokes by using the ```insert keystrokes``` command

3. Setting a field value
    Using the ```Set Field``` command, you can set a field value,similar to how you assign a value to an input box on an HTML page.Fields are defined by name or index,so be sure and get the field name or index ahead of time

4. Recieving Text
    After sending text,you can recieve the response from the terminal using the ```Get Text``` command,which is coordinate-based

5. Receiving a field value
    Using the ```Get Field``` command, you can get a field value,which is similar to getting the value of an input box on a HTML page.

6. Recieving all field values
    You can also use the ```Get All Fields``` command to recieve all the field values and their field names into an array.Getting all fields allows you to reverse engineer a terminal field set that was not documented or for which the documentation was lost.

7. Waiting for a response
    Use the ```Wait``` command to wait for a specific bit of text to be sent to the emulator from the mainframe.This allows for a good pacing of messaging because the older systems tend to make some time to respond to messages

8. Controlling the cursor positioning
    Using the ```Control``` command,you can also control terminals cursor positioning, similar to the cursor positioning available on the old IBM terminals

9. Disconnecting from the remote system
    Once all the data is sent and recieved, you can disconnect from the remote system using the ```Disconnect``` command

### High Availability and Disaster Recovery with CR
* High - Availability Deployment Model
<img src="Images/High_Availability_and_DisasterRecovery.png"/>

* High Availability and Disaster Recovery Deployment Model
<img src="Images/High_Availability_and_DisasterRecovery_Deployment-Model.png">

* for HA Configuration , following things should be kept in mind
    1. Installation process is same as normal
    2. while checking for database and port, open ```pg.hba.conf``` file and add a tag at last of file that is ```host all all ip-of-server/port-of-server md5```

* Why High Availability Required -> It is required for
    1. Maximum Up-time/Availability: Threats to service availability pertaining to hardware and network failure, storage corruption, and unacceptable Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) responses
    2. Least Failure: Protects the business processes at single point
* When HA is setup -> HA setup is required:
    1. When there is focus on delivering the optimal performance and availability
    2. When installing Control Room (CR) for the first time
* Where to setup HA -> It is required:
    1. With distributed mode, HA of Web Control Room (Can be achieved), however it required proper planning and seamless installation
    2. It is necessary to have HA for Enterprise deployment architecture of Control Room

* Why Disaster Recovery Required:
    1. Switching over to another infrastructure failure with minimal downtime
    2. Reducing the down time of business processes/functions, as any threat to service availability could result in:
        * Hardware or network failure
        * Data loss and storage issues
* When to setup Disaster Recovery -> DR is required for:
    1. When the Control Room is set up in Production environment as backup to manage any unwanted/unexpected failure
    2. To mitigate the impact of infrastructure during disaster
    3. To comply with business continuity standards
* Where to setup Disaster Recovery:
    1. Across different physical locations as per the business continuity standards to achieve optimal Recovery Point Objective(RPO) of an organization
    2. In different buildings in the same city or across different geographical locations
    3. DR infrastructure can be setup based on data that can be accessed both at live and DR locations
* Business Continuity Plan describes the plan for disaster recovery

### Control Room: Post Installation Configuration
Once installation is complete. We configure the following aspects of Control Room:
1. Repository Path
2. Control Room Access URL (Local or Load Balancer-based)
3. Control Room Authentication; which could be:
    * Non-Active Directory Authentication
    * LDAP Authentication
    * SAML2 Authentication


## FAQs 
### (Licenses)
1. I have just installed license v11.x Why is it still asking me to provide a license key?
Ans. ```Please make sure that you have never installed v11.x in the past on this machine, whose 30-day trial period expired. If you have tried to change the date in your system during the trial period, your license will have expired, and you need to provide the correct license.```
2. Can I use my v10.x license for v11.x CR?
Ans. ```No```
3. Can the Master Key be regenerated after 1st setup of CR
Ans. ```No```
4. Can License service port be changed post istallation
Ans. ```Yes, with certificate import via command line in Installation guide, you can update the SSL certificate in case of expiration, SAN addition, or modification. You must then restart AAE Reverse proxy service to let the certificate take effect.```

### (Servers)
1. Does v11 support Cloud based setup and what are the best practices for cloud setup?
Ans. ```Yes,you just need to use same database for CR and BotInsight```
2. Does v11 support DB as PaaS for SQL and Postgres database?
Ans. ```Yes```
3. What is the minimum server requirement for HA setup of v11 CR?
Ans. ```The server requires a minimum of 2 CR application nodes, in case of SQL as separate 2 SQL cluster node for DB, 1 Load balancer, NAS or SAN file repository for SMB file share. If Postgres is used as remote then additional Postgres server. ```

### (Ports)
1. Can LDP for child domain URL be used for LDAP authentication setup with port 389 and 636?
Ans. ```No, v11 only supports LDAP for Global CataLog of Parent domain. The Global CataLog LDAP works over ports 3268 and 3269. E.g. if your domain is oprInd.oprGlob.com then the LDAP URL “ldap://oprInd.OprGlob.com” which would be your India level Domain would not work, you need to use parent domain LDAP URL i.e. “ldap://OprGlob.com” (over 3268) ```
2. What is the Postgres server recommendation for remote Postgres installation to be used?
Ans. ```V11 does support remote Postgres for version 9.5.x only. For versions prior to v11.2 you need to use a default database named “zoomdata”, with “postgres” as the default username and “5432” as the default port. From version 11.2 onwards can customise the database name, user or port. ```
3. What are the other ports used by v11 CR which are not provided during installation?
Ans. ```Besides HTTP/HTTPS port, SQL and Postgres ports provided during installation, AAE Control Room uses 8080 or next available port for License service. Port 5672, range 47100-47200 and 47500- 47600 are used for cluster communication in HA & DR setup. ```
4. Can the cluster communication ports be changed post installation?
Ans. ```No, the cluster communication ports cannot be changed and are set as default, you need to keep these ports open in local as well as network firewall for seamless cluster communication. ```

    3. Local Scheduler ~> It Involves task execution for local schedules
3. Bot Creator Desktop Components
    1. Task Editor
    2. Event Watcher
    3. Reports
    4. Bot Player

### Client Server Communication
<u>Refresh Token</u>

* A mechanism to maintain a unqiue sesion for every user
* Unique json token (JWT) which keeps changing at regular intervals
* Introduced to authenticate the REST calls from AAE Client
* Control Room Server returns respose with payload containing status codes for each incoming access token to be refreshed
* Life cycle of refresh token is:
    1. Create Token
        * A Token is composed of client information & License details
        * First login access token from server is passed on to client service to refresh at a regular interval of 5 mins.
    2. Refresh Access Token
        * Client Service(Windows service) is responsible for refreshing the token at the predefined interval
        * Runs on a separate thread from the existing ping call to the Control Room
        * Control Room validates the access token
        * If validation fails,
            * Unauthorized access response is sent back
            * Service clears the user session from memory
            * All Client applications,except player, gets terminated with notification,after 5 minutes
        * If validation succeeds, a new access token will be returned
    3. Token Expiry
        * When the user token expires,Refresh Token will return the empty token
        * Client service will terminate all AAE Client Applications after notification
        * User can re-login to the client
    4. License Change
        * If there is any change in license on server side,RefreshToken will return the License Changed flag as "True"
        * Client service will terminate all AAE Client APplications after notifications
        * User can re-login to the client and new license changes can take effect
* Refresh Token Configuration
    1. Access Token Refresh Time Interval = Max 300 seconds
    2. Fail Over Retry Count = Max3
    3. Time Between Retry = Max 15 seconds(default 3)
    4. Request Time Out In Second = Max 60 seconds (default 15)
    
    These Configurations can be configured from ```AAClietService.exe``` config file
    (Default file Path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Automation Anywhere\Enterprise\Client\AAClientService.exe config)
    Note: Restart Automation Anywhere Client Service, for the changes to take effect

# Bot Deployment

## Pre-Requisites
1. A Bot Runner machine registered with Control Room 
2. A Bot to be deployed
3. A Control Room User with permission to deploy a Bot.Following visibility parameters are driven by Role and permissions which assigned to User:
    * Run Button 
    * Bot
    * Devices

## API Overview
* A CR user use 3rd party API's to deploy Bots or tasks to Bot Runners on commencement of external 3rd party or an external application
* Key features and business benefits of Control Rooms APIs:
    1. Bots can be deployed from an external third party systems susing AAE APIs
    2. The input and output of APIs is JSON based (industry standard data-interchange format)
    3. Bot Deployment can be orchestrated from an External Application/Workflow using a combination of scripts and AAE APIs
* The Bot Deployment API can only be invoked once the system/user has authenticated using the Authentication API
* Deployment API is used to deploy Bots to Bot Runners.User will need to have "Run my Bots" privileges and the privileges of the Bot Runners on which the Bot is to be deployed
<img src="Images/Run and Schedule based Bot Deployment.png" />

<img src="Images/RDP Based Deployment Flow.png" />
<img src="Images/RDP Based Deployment Flow1.png" />

* Once the bot is created on the CR, a deployment notification is sent to the Bot Client.

## Troubleshooting for Bot Deployment: Best Practices
1. For all types of deployment
* Ensure Bot Runner machine reachable from Control Room machine via FQDN(Fully Qualified Domain Name) as displayed on Bot Runner machine's computer properties
* Ensure Auto-Login settings are enabled to Clint machine to ensure player invocation in corect user profile
2. For RDP based deployment
* Tools ~> Options:
    * Username and Passwords need to be set
    * "Auto Login your computer when the task runs" needs be checked
    * "Bypass legal disclaimer" needs to be unchecked
* Machine status should be either "Locked" or "Log off"
* Legal Disclaimer should be disabled
* Player should not be running on machine
* Remote connection should be allowed from machine

## Overview
* Dependency scanner ~> the mechanismo of scanning the child tasks,MetaBots , and referenced documents is known as dependency scanner
* Prerequisites:
    1. Ensure all the dependent files are uploaded and available on CR
    2. Control Room user who initiates the Run or creates schedules, must have permissions of folders where dependent files are available
    3. When Apache Subversion (SVN) is integrated, Run Event will deploy latest version of SVN copy,hence, it doesn't verify the production is set or not.However , while scheduling a Bot, it will check the production version of all child Bots, hence ensure production version is set for all child Bots.
* TroubleShooting ~ when dependent files are shown as missing, ensure that:
    1. Production Version is set in case SVN is enabled
    2. File does exist on server, and should be on same path as referred in Master Bot
    3. Folder permission must be available to the user
    4. No custom variables are used.Encourage to use ```$AAAPlicationPath``` system variable to get the dependency auto resolved

# SVN
* Mechanism of versioning and revision control of tasks
* AA manages the Subversioning using Visual SVN server which is updated to Apache Subversion
* Version Control Integration, if enabled in Automation Anywhere is carried out through Subversion,provided by the Apache Subversion software project
* Distributed as open source under the Apache License
<table>
<th>Apache Subversion</th>
<th>SVN Server</th>
<tr>
<td>Subversion 1.9.7</td><td>Visual SVN Server 3.6.x</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Subversion 1.8.13 and 1.8.14</td><td>Visual SVN Server 3.3.x</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Subversion 1.7.2</td><td>Visual SVN Server 2.5.2</td>
</tr>
</table>

## <u> SVN Repositories</u>
* There are 2 kind of Repositories
1. Control Room Repository ~> Folder/file-based structure on DIstributed File System (DFS),Network Attached Storage(NAS),Storage Area Network(SAN) or any other windows-based file loctaion
2. SVN Repository ~> Internal SVN Repository,not visible from functioning point of view

## Configuration - SVN Repos
1. Create the Repositories ~> For this, right-click Repositories because AA product only supports empty Repository
2. Don't forget to create an Empty Repository because AA product only supports empty Repository
3. Add the Internet Information Service(IIS) application pool Identity user in the SVN Repositor permissions
4. After creating the repository, Create User in the SVN by Launching Visual SVN Server,Right-Click Users, and Create User
5. Enter User Name and Password in the pop-up window
Also, make sure the user in the SVN has Read/Write permissions to the SVN repository created
6. Once a Repository is created,you will see a similar screen

<img src="Images/Configuring_SVN.png"> 
7. The actual Repository path will be displayed at the top of the screen. This path can be used to browse the Repository from the Web Browser.

## Integrating SVN with AA
1. Launch Control Room -> Administration -> Settings -> Bots
2. Enter the details
3. Connect
* Syncing of Control Room and SVN Repository is known as ```Base Version Upload```
* Do not interrupt the process
* It may take hours, depending on the size of the Control Room Repository and uplaod speed between CR and SVN servers

## AA Client Upload Life Cycle

```Upload file from Client``` -> ```Validate the upload permission for the User``` -> ```CR recieves the file and sends to ``` ->
1. ```QueueStore Folder``` -> ```Sends a copy of file to SVN Repository```
2. ```CR Repository Path``` -> ```Confirmation sent to client machine for successful upload```

<img src="Images/Upload From Client Side- Workflow.png" />

1. File Splitter ~> Split the file into multiple parts , that 4mb of each by default (is configurable)
2. File Parts Uploader ~> Sends HTTP/HTTPS request to CR to initialize the File Upload
3. FileParts Storage Folder ~> As soon as files are recieved at CR , its created by default in the Repository application Path if not present
4. A Unique session ID is allotted to all the chunks/parts of the file being uploaded
5. Chunk Collector ~> Collects all the file parts being uploaded through AAE Client and sequentially stores them in File Parts Storage to prevent its corruption
6. Chunk Merger ~> As soon as all parts are uploaded, merge all the file parts and check the checksum value to be same as sent by the Client in the original request
7. After the above process, the file is updated in the meta data and stored in the Database
8. If the SVN is on, file is also copied to SVN's QueueStore Folder and one by one sent to SVN

## AA Client Download Life Cycle
<img src="Images/Download from Client Side - Workflow.png" />

1. Downloading is initiated from Client Side by sending an HTTP/HTTPs request to CR
2. On receiving the request for download from the AAE Client, the CR splits the file into chunks and sends information about number of chunks and the checksum of the whole file to AAE Client
3. The file that is to be downloaded is split up into parts in this filesplitterstorage folder and each will have the unique download session ID
4. If the SVN is on and requested file version is available, The Queue Store/SVN Store will send each part and the chunks will be collected by Chunk Collector in the AAE Client
5. Once all chunks are downloaded,they are merged by the Chunk Merger and it gives a response stating download is successful


# Credential Vault
* A Credential Vault provides a secured way to manage common and user specific credentials.It also provides a way for Bots to consume the credentials in a secure way.
* Base CV functionality is to:
    1. Create my own credentials and locker to group credentials
    2. Grant owner and participant permission to manage locker and locker content (i.e credentials)
    3. Grant Usage privilege on a Locker via Role (i.e. Grant Role(s) use access to a Locker)
    4. Access credentials from the CV while running a TaskBot
    5. Use user-specific / common credentials while running a TaskBot
    6. Audit usage of credentials
    7. All credentials are persisted in database in encrypted form and decrypted in runtime when needed

## CV Keys
<img src="Images/CV Keys.png" />

* while generating keys, ```private key``` is saved externally by the admin
* AAE works with ```CYBERARK``` to provide CV to users
* You are not required to :
    1. Store your sensitive data in two places or copy and paste data such as your passwords from CyberArk Password Vault to Automation Anywhere Credential Vault
    2. Maintain data security in two places
* Key Benefits:
    1. Clients get the ability to securely retrieve the credentials needed for the Bots to perform their functions.
    2. CyberArk rotates the credentials to ensure the Client stays in compliance with corporate policies and industry guidelines.
    

# License Management
## Bot User Licenses
1. Bot creator (Development) ~> Users with privilege to create and automate Bot(s) in Client
2. Bot runner(Run time with TaskBots) ~> Users with privilege to run Bot(s)
3. BotFarm (Run time) ~> Bot user count of licenses, measured in number of hours used by all runtime clients within BotFarm to execute a Bot
4. Bot Insight ~> It shows 2 things:
    * The number of users having Business Analytics role, i.e., Bot Insight Consumer or Expert
    * The Application Program Interface (API) count measured in number of rows that API fetches from Bot Insight database
    * If you have a Bot Insight license, Operational Analytics is available by default with CR v11.0

## License Installation Steps
* A CR Admin or a user with License management permission can install a License and evaluate Control Room version 11.0
* By default, a trial license(30 D) is shipped that offers three Bot Creators and two Bot Runners
* To Install a License
```Select Administration -> Licenses tab``` ~> ```Select Install License button``` ~> ```Browse the License file``` ~> ```Select Install```


## Error Messages
1. When a file with invalid or an expired License is selected
2. When a file with different extension other than ```.License```, is selected
3. When a file is either deleted or moved to another location
4. When current License is expired

## Role Based Access Control : Role Types
* The Control Room license management is made more granular and controlled via seperate permissions
1. ```View License Permission``` ~> View license details from the Licenses page
2. ```Manage User Device License Permission``` ~> Allocate / deallocate / release licenses
3. ```Install License Permission``` ~> Install a new Control Room license
* The License Management access can be set while creating Roles


## Mechanism of License Installation
* Ensure that ```Automation Anywhere Licensing``` service is up and running during installation of licenses adn through out the usage of product
* Ensure that the ```8080``` port is vacant before installation and no other application on the server machine is assigned to use the 8080 port because the licensing service gets installed and runs on 8080 port
* Validate if the license service is running on the 8080 port, in case of any Licensing Server / service related error messages
* Ensure that licensing service is able to reach Control Room DB server and the user configured to run the service has access of the Control Room Database

<img src="Images/mechanism of License Installation.png" />

##  License Downgrade Scenario
* License downgrade is a scenario or condition where devices counts (Bot Creator, Bot Runners) are lesser than the existing utilized counts
* In Such scenario ,the Admin will be required to first deallocate the license and bring the used counts equal or less to counts availed in new license file
<img src="Images/License Downgrade.png" />

    2. Server Host Name ~> It is the fully qualified name of the CR database server
    3. Server Port ~> It is the port to which the database is configured
    4. Database Name ~> It is the database that will be used to store CR data
    5. The values are not displayed

* Control Room Administration
    1. Control Room repository shows the location where all Bots,application files, and supporting files are stored
    2. Default location: ```C:\ProgramData\AutomationAnywhere\Server Files```
    3. The default path can be edited post installation but just remember to :
        * Copy the existing files to another location
        * Put the CR in maintenance mode
        * Inform users to disconnect their devices from the CR instance
    4. ```Select Edit``` ~> ```Change Path``` ~> ```Save Path```

    2. Session settings ~> Allow or disallow users to be automatically logged into CR when they navigate to the Control Room URL via browser if Control Room is configured for Kerberos enabled Active Directory Authentication
    3. By default these settings are ```Enabled```
    
* Deployment Settings ~> Shows whether the users with run and schedule privileges can choose to run Bot Runner session on CR when you deploy or schedule a Bot

* Security
    1. It defines the password policy settings for all the CR users
    2. We can customize the password length,password content , and/or select the number of log on attempts allowed
    3. Password policy is only enabled for a CR that is configured for Database authentication type

## Client Application Settings
* Device Health Check Configuration ~> It allows you to set the time interval for Device Health check that includes parameters such as Central Processing Unit or CPU, Memory and Disk usage etc. You can set the frequency at which the data is exchanged between Control Room and connected Clients
* To modify Device health check configuraton:
    1. First Select the Client application
    2. Then Click Edit, the page opens in edit mode wherein the ```Blip interval during bot execution``` can be enabled.The default value is set to 60 seconds
    3. Change the Blip interval time as required.Please note that ,you cannot input less than sixty or empty value otherwise an error is shown
    4. After changing interval, click ```Save Changes```

## Email Settings
* As CR admin, we can send email notifications to other CR users when certain activities that affect the users are updated
* By default, email notifications are disabled
* When they are enabled, all users have to confirm their account by clicking on the confirmation link that they receive in their email account, set the password and security questions, and login to the CR

## Users
* View the detailed information of existing users
* with user management privileges, you can view,edit,delete, and enable or disable a user
* Perform other actions, such as delete multiple users, export the list of users in CSV format, refresh the list in the Users table, and show or hide columns in the Users table and you can also Create a user and role
* when you specify search parameters for the same column, the system searches using ```OR``` operator. When you specify search parameters for different columns, the system searches using ```AND``` operator
* when you use special keys ```_``` or ```-```, the system lists all Usernames instead of Usernames having these parameters

<img src="Images/User_Column_Actions.png" />
<img src="Images/User_Individual_Actions.png" />


## Create Active Directory Users
* To create an active directory user, the user must be a part of an active directory
* Perform the given steps to create an active directory user:
    1. First, log on to CR with administration privileges
    2. Navigate to the Users page
    3. Click, create user link
* In the General details area:
    1. Select the ```Enable user``` check box to enable the user
    2. Select the active directory name for the user.The list displays all domains that are available in Active Directory domain controller
    3. Type a user name for the user, the ```Check name in Active Directory``` button is enabled
    4. When you click ```Check name in Active Directory``` button, one of the following happens
        * If the user name is present in the Active Directory, the First,Last name, email and confirm email fields are automatically displayed
        * If the user name is not present in  the active directory, an error message is displayed

## Edit Directory User Details
* As an administrator, You can edit the details of an active directory user from the Users page
* But you cannot change the Username and Active Directory domain for a user nor your own profile
* You need to contact an administrator to change the username of an active directory user
* When you edit the details of a user, an email is sent to the user
* These changes are audit logged and authorized users can refer to it in the future

## Managing Users
* To remove redundant users, and free allocated license, a CR Admin user can delete users
* When an admin user deletes a user from CR, the user is displayed as Inactive appended to their name
* One of the details shown in the ```USER DETAILS``` section on the Users page is ```License Status```


## Data Migration and Version Comparison
* Before starting data migration between client v10.x and client 11.x , ensure that
    1. Backup is created for 10.x AA applcation folder , public documents, and program data
    2. 10.x LTS CR must be migrated to 11.x
    3. User must be migrated to 11.x CR

<img src="Images/Client Migration.png"/>

* After Migration process, a file named ```Flips Data Migration``` that is the log file of migration is located at the application path

* Various Differences between V10 and V11 are

<img src ="v10 vs v11.png" />
<img src ="V10 vs V11_1.png" />
<img src ="V10 vs V11_2.png" />
<img src ="V10 vs V11_3.png" />

## Audit Trail Reading
* Understanding Basic Table Elements
    1. Status ~> Displays the status of the action - whether it is "successfull" or "unsuccessful"
    2. Time ~> Displays the data and time of performed action
    3. Action Type ~> Displays the type of action performed by users
    4. Item Name ~> Displays the entity on which action was performed
    5. Action Taken By ~> User that performed the action
    6. Source Device ~> Displays the device/machine name/IP address used to perform the action
    7. Source ~> Displays the component from where action originated or was performed such as the CR,Client or API.

* The Audit Details Page is divided into 2 sections:
    1. Action Details ~> Shows details including Status,Object type,and Time
    2. Action Type Details ~> Shows details such as ATTRIBUTE and VALUE


## Workload Management Queue
* Used for processing of data round the clock by creating a pool of Runners and executing tasks, so that the Runners are utilized in better way and data can be processed in parallel
* WLM Queue ~> Collection of all data (work items) to be processed and associated configuration
* WLM Device Pool ~> Collection of all Runners on which Bot is executed and associated configuration
* WLM Bot ~> Bot marked with queue category in variable manager
* Insert Work Item(Queue) ~> Command is used to push work item in queue
* Work Item (Column name) ~> Variables used in Bot to pull data from queue and process further

* Various Roles and their funcationalities in WLM are:
    1. Queue Admin ~> User with Queue Admin role can create a queue
    2. Pool Admin ~> User with Pool Admin role can create Device Pool
    3. CR Admin ~> CR Admin can create these users or one user can have both these roles
    4. Queue Participant ~> Queue Participant needs a user defined role and it makes all users with that role a participant of the queue - they can push work items to queue
    5. Queue Consumer ~> Queue Consumer needs a user defined role and it makes all users with that role as consumer of queue - they can consume work items in Bot from queue
    6. Pool Consumer ~> Pool Consumer needs a user defined role and it is associated with Queue Consumer as unless both are in synch, queue cannot be scheduled on device pool

* WLM Component : Queue
1. Owners: Can be many owners and is advised to add CR admin as owner of queue as admin privileges are required to stop the queue
2. Partipants : Users who can add work item to a queue.Select a user defined role which is assigned to user
3. Consumers : Users, generally Runners, who will consume work items from queue. Select a user defined role which is assigned to user
4. Work Item Structure : Defines work item in queue. Queue Category is mandatory and it works like business process mapping of a queue.Column Structure is associated with queue category.So, if you create a new queue and map same category, column structure is copied to new queue.Queue Category is then mapped with Bot in Variable Manager to indicate which queue is accessible for Bot
5. Reactivation Threshold ~> Needs to be defined the time of queue creation which indicates on how many new work items in queue, queue gets activated again

* <u>WLM Components : Device Pool Execution</u>
For Successful device pool execution,the Queue Consumer and the Pool Consumer must have the same role
* For execution of multiple queues on the same Device Pool , the Pool Admin can configure execution in two ways:
    1. Round Robin
    2. Priority
* Round Robin ~> Round Robin configuration gives a time slice, which indicates for how many seconds, minutes, or hours work items from one queue get executed, and then the task from the next queue is executed
* Priority ~> Priority setup gives an option to select priorities between multiple queues running on same Device Pool.In this case,all work items from priority one queue get executed before work items from the second priority queue.

* Insert Work Item 
    1. Pushes work item in queue
    2. Shows a list of all queues associated with logged in user
    3. Can be used along with other commands like Loop or Excel
* Work Item can be consumed using variable ```$WorkItem(Column)$```
* Data can be uploaded into queue manually by simply uploading a csv file


## Bot Life Cycle Management
* Various Pre-requisites for Import or Export a Bot and its dependencies are:
* The End User System initiates export of Bots from Control Room 1 and initiates import to Control Room 2
1. Export Pre-requisites
    * The CR user authenticating the export must have:
        * ```Export Bots``` permission
        * ```Download``` permission for the Bots and dependencies
    * If Version Control is enabled in the source CR:
        * The ```production version``` of all Bots and dependencies myst be set
    * The user account being used to run the CR services must have access to the ```export destination```
2. Import Pre-requisites
    * The CR user authenticating the imports must have:
        * Import Bots permission
        * Upload permission for the Bots and the dependencies
    * The CR user executing utility to importing multiple Bots must have access to the exported package file provided by AA

<img src="Images/Bot Life Cycle Component Diagram.png" />

<img src="Images/Bot Life Cycle Sequence Diagram.png" />


## Role Bases Access Control
* Benefits of creating roles include:
    1. Increased security by controlling users access according to their specified roles
    2. Decreased need of customer support
    3. Easy and accurate monitoring of the use and access of data by higher management, leading to better research management
* usernames can not contain special characters
* System-created roles for BotFarm,Bot Insight and Cognitive Platform apps are displayed based on purchased license
* View dashboards is a default permission available to all roles and users
* A non-Admin user having the roles permission cannot see the Admin role.This is a filtration between Admin and non-Admin roles.If you are an Admin, you can see all the roles, but if you are non-Admin, then you cannot see the Admin roles
* The system checks for Admin using the keyword ```AAE_admin``` in admins name
* If Control Room is integrated with Active Directory or SMTP enabled,Password and Confirm Password field will not be visible
* In case of Active Directory integrated, CR do not set and manage password.Validation will be performed by integrated Active Directory Server
* In case of SMTP enabled and non-Active Directory, email will send to the user to set the password


# Public API
* AAE enables third-party applications to consume RPA , orchestrate bots, and manage the RPA data based on events
* The CR offers APIs to automatically:
    1. Authenticate users
    2. Manage Bot login credentials
    3. Deploy Bots
    4. Export and import Bots for BLM(Business Lifecycle Management)
    5. Export and Import Workload Management (WLM) Configuration.
    6. Fetch the list and details of work items in the CR or add/insert work item to a given queue.

## Authentication API
* It precedes all other APIs
* Invoking third-party application user needs to be authenticated to use downstream APIs
* Takes two parameters as inputs in JSON.These include  
    1. Username of AAE user
    2. Password of AAE user
* If the URL of the CR is ```https://ultron.com:81``` then URL of Authentication API will be ```https://ultron.com:81/v1/authentication```
* The authentication is only valid for ```15 minutes``` from the time it is used

* Response Codes
    1. 200 ~> Authentication is successful
    2. 401 (invalid credentials) ~> Invalid Password / User does not exist / Active Directory Authentication Credentials are invalid
    3. 401 (Unverified Email) ~> Email notification is enabled - user has not verified email
    4. 402 ~> License has expired
    5. 403 ~> User is deactivated

## Login Credentials API
* To automate updating of passwords, CR 11.1 provides a direct API to create , update or delete ```Login Credentials``` in ```Credential Vault```
* Only CR Administrators or users having AAE Admin Roles can use it
* It will use authentication token obtained using Authentication API.This token has to be passed to the Login Credentials API
* Takes 3 inputs:
    1. Username (AAE)
    2. Login (Windows) username
    3. Login (Windows) password

* Managing User Credentials ~> CR Admins can manage user credentials using HTTP methods like
    1. POST ~> CR admins can create a user's login credentials in the CR
    2. PUT ~> CR admins can update the user's login credentials in the CR
    3. DELETE ~> CR admins can delete the user's login credentials in the CR


## Deployment API
* These API's are used to deploy Bots/tasks on Bot Runners on commencement of events specified by third-party/external application
* Input and Output of APIs is based on JSON (the industry standard data-interchange format)
* Bot deployment can be orchestrated from an external application/workflow using combination of scripts and AAE APIs
* To use these,the user needs ```Run my Bots``` privileges and privilege of Bot Runner on which bot is to be run
* It takes 3 parameters:
    1. Bot name with relative path (mandatory)
    2. List of Bot-Runners and users in JSON format (mandatory)
    3. Use RDP-based approach (optional,"false" by default)
* Response Codes:
    1. 200 ~> Successful creation of automation

## BLM Export-Import API
* Using this API, we can introduce a customized Bot Lifecycle Management (BLM) solution to remove all external factors that could possibly disrupt your automation life cycle
* Using this API we can manage the dependent files in different environments such as:
    1. Development
    2. Testing
    3. Acceptance
    4. Production
* End point for Export:
    ```<Control Room URL>/v1/alm/export```

## Auto-Login Process Workflow
<img src="Images/Auto Login Process Workflow.png" />

<img src="Images/Auto Login Troubleshoot.png" />

* There are 3 types of logs to refer in case of Auto-Login failure:
    1. Auto-Login debug level logs
    2. Player Logs
    3. Client Service/Scheduler Service debug level Logs

* Sequence of using logs to troubleshoot Auto-Login failure
1. Client Service/Schedule Service log ~> It receives a call to trigger task execution and invokes the player
2. Player log
    * when player application gets invoked,it checks machine state
    * if session is ```On```, it initiates task execution; otherwise , it validates if the Login settings are configured and Auto-Login is tick marked
    * If settings are correctly configured,it requests Auto-Login to do its job and kills Players application instance with the entry-ending player after requesting for Auto-login
3. Auto-Login Log:
    * Receives Auto-Login request by player
    * Performs Ctrl+Alt+Del
    * Create info.xml file at common folder path with requirments parameters for Auto-Login and task execution
4. Credential Log ~> ```Automation.CredentialProvider.dll``` keeps watch on the common folder path. As soon as the info.xml is found it triggers Auto-Login and reads parameters values from the file,decrypts the password , deletes the info.xml and performs AutoLogin to the Systems on LogonUI.exe
5. As soon as autologin happens, it sets machine status as ```SessionUnlock``` , and updates machine status in Automation.Autologin.Settings.xml file
6. Player log ~> Player application gets invoked by Auto-Login service and revalidates machine state.If machine is found in ```Sessionunlock``` or ```Console``` state,it will start task execution otherwise, it will exit the loop with particular failure error
7. Auto-login log ~> Once the player complete execution,it requests the Auto-Login to put machine back to original state
8. Credential Log~> Log displays machine status set back to its original state(locked,logged off or disconnected)
9. Auto-Login log ~> updates machine status in Automation.Autologin.Settings.xml file
10. Player Log ~> It ends player application instance
Note : 
* if Auto-Login happens successfully,it invokes the ```explorer.exe` but in case it does not come in Processes,it will timeout the Auto-Login process,the CredentialProvider removes Info.xml forcefully and the same entry will found at step 5
* The default Timeout is set to 60 seconds and is configurable
* The Auto-Login code is successfully hooked with the OS application when both the AutoLogin.txt and CredentialLog.txt files are present in the LogFiles folder


## Plugins
### Troubleshooting for Flex
* If you are unable to capture Flex objects in IE-11, follow these steps:
1. Tools ~> Options ~> Plugin Settings
2. Check if the Flex plugin is installed
3. Navigate to the mm.cfg configuration file
4. Open the configuration file with Notepad
5. Change the username:
    ```
    PreloadSwf=C:\Users\ABC\Automation Anywhere to PreloadSwf=C:\Users\Username1\Automation Anywhere.
    ```
6. Save the mm.cfg configuration file at:
    ```%homedrive%%homepath%```
7. Launch AAE Client before opening the Flex application

## Troubleshooting for Flex: Plugin Popup Issue
* To Identify if Flex application is connected with AA Proxy Server:
1. Close AAProxyServer.exe from the Task Manager
2. navigate to the installation path: ```C:\Program Files(x86)\Automation Anywhere Enterprise 10.3\Client```
3. In the address bar,type ```AAProxyserver.exe /u```
4. Open the Flex application and check the connection status in the AAProxyServer.exe UI

##  Troubleshooting for JAVA Plugin: Not Enabled
* At times,the Java plugin might not get enabled in AAE Client plugin settings after installation. The solution is to enable Java Access Bridge(JAB) on your system
* There are two ways of doing so:
```First```
1. Go to the ```Ease of Access Center``` in the ```Control Panel```
2. Select ```Use the computer without a display``` option
3. Under ```other programs installed```,select the ```Enable Java Access Bridge``` check box
4. Next, click Apply and then click OK

```Second```
* Go to the ```Command prompt```
* Run the command to enable the JAB
* Replace or set the JAB path to JRE_HOME on the system where you are running the command


# SSL Certificate
## SAN Certificates
* <u>Subject Alternative Name</u>
    1. Can cover multiple domain names on just one certificate
    2. All the names must belong to the same domain
    e.g,www.example.com, example.com, mail.example.com
* <u>Wildcard Certificates</u>
    1. Secure website URL and unlimited number of its subdomains
    2. Certificate requested for ```*.coolexample.com``` will apply for:
        * coolexample.com
        * www.coolexample.com
        * photos.coolexample.com
        * blog.coolexample.com
* <u>EV certificates (Extended Validation)/EV SSL Certificates</u>
    1. Activate both the padlock and the green address bar in all major browsers
    2. Provide the strongest encryption level available
        ```secure:https://www```

## What to validate in SSL Certificate
1. Certificate Format
    * Automation supports ```.Pfx``` format only
    * Certificate Conversion Website: ```https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-converter.html```
2. Certificate Issued to
    * Certificate should contain Domain Name System of the servers,including Standardized Query Language Database(SQL DB) Server Certificate,if required
    * Subject Alternative Name(SAN) extension allows additional identities to be bound to the subject of the certificate
    * DNS Name extension is used to add a fully qualified domain name to a SSL certificate
3. Certificate Issuer
    * Issuer Field identifies the entitiy who has signed and issued the certificate
    * It contains the Distinguished Name(DN) information for the Intermediate Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate for SSL certificates
4. Certificate Validity
    * After validating the certificate issue, the Certificate Validity should be verified.
    * The fields ```Valid From``` and ```Valid To``` indicate the validity period of the SSL certificate
5. Certificate Chain
    * A chain or path begins with the SSL certificate 
    * And each signed by entity identified by next certificate in the chain
    * The list of SSL certificates, from the root certificate to the end-user certificate,represents the SSL certificate chain
    * The Intermediate certificate is the signer/issuer of the SSL certificate
    * Similarly, root CA Certificate is the signer/issuer of the intermediate certificate
    * The location of the certificate in AA is
    ```C:\Program Files\Automation Anywhere\Enterprise\pki```

    <img src="Images/SSL Chain Certificate.png" />

## Scenarios requiring post installation configuration of certificate:
1. SSL Certificate expiring
2. Change from Self signed certificate to CA certificate
3. Move from HTTP to HTTPs protocol


# Logs
* Logs are application diagnostic information which is generated over the time and are useful for troubleshooting in case of faulty behaviour of the application
* Logs are generated 
    1. For every module of the AAE application ecosystems
    2. In the sequence of occurrence along with the Data/Time stamp
* Logging Levels:
    1. Info 
        * Info logs are information messages which give primary information of an event that has occurred
        * This information is useful for routing analysis like service Start/Stop, configuration assumptions, successful initialization, successful completion of significant transactions,etc.
        e.g., When a CR service gets started/shutdown
    2. Error 
        * It is the 2nd level of failure,indicates that somethinf more critical has occurred.
        e.g., While adding user with username which already exists or a database service has stopped working
    3. Fatal
        * It is used to record system generated exceptions leading to user experience being entirely ceased.
        * For instance, a component which is central to the operation of the application has failed in a way that leaves it in an unstable state,with only possible course of action being to terminate the application altogether
    4. Debug
        * This is the fourth level of error and designates those fine-grained informational events which are most useful to debug an application
    5. Trace
        * Logging level trace is the highest level and covers all oher levels underneath.
        * e.g., Debug,info,errr,fatal
        * Tracing is a very useful level to trace complete workflow end to end. This can be used for troubleshooting and diagnosing purpose
* Best Practices:
    1. The number of log files should be increased and the file size should be kept small
    2. A user should be able to change log configuration for services run with system user account
        * Log configuration for services should be maintained in a common file accessible by all users
        * Since the services are shared among all users of the system,enabling logs for services will enable them for all users of the system
    3. A user should be able to change log configuration for application without impacting other user's logging preferences,in case of applications run with individual user's account
        * Each user's logging preferences should be kept in seperate location accessible by them only

3. Citrix Receiver
* Provides quick secure self-service access to documents, applications and desktops from any of the user's devices
* Provides on-demand access to windows, web and Software as a Services applications for devices that cannot install receiver software
* Provides a connection through a HTML5 compatible web browser

4. Citrix Studio
* It is the management console to configure and manage deployment, eliminating the need for a separate management console for managing the delivery of applications and desktops
* Guide in the environment setup process
* Help create workloads to host applications and desktop
* Assign applications and desktops to the users

5. Machine Catalog
* Collections of the virtual/physical machines that are managed as a single entity
* Have resources like an application/virtual desktops that provide users with dynamic and static machine assignment mechanism
* Have the same operating system and same VDA installed
* Have the same applications/virtual desktops available on them
* A Master image is used to create identical virtual machines in the catalogs

6. Machine Types
* Various Machine Types are:
    1. Windows Server OS machine:
        * Virtual or physical machines based on a Windows server operating system are used for delivering XenApp or XenDesktop
        * These machines allow multiple users to connect to them at one time
    
    2. Desktop OS Machine:
        * Virtual or physical machines based on a Windows desktop operating system are used for delivering VDI desktops, VM hosted applications and Hosted physical desktops
        * These machines allow only one user at a time to connect to them
    
    3. Remote PC Access:
        * Provide access to users devices included on a whitelist
        * Enables accessing resources on office PCs remotely, from any device
        * Allows access management to office PCs through the XenDesktop deployment

* Delivery Groups -> Collection of users given to access a common group of resources
    1. Delivery Groups contain machines from the machine catalogs and active directory users
    2. A Delivery group can contain machines from one or more Machine Catalog, but each individual machine can only belong to one Delivery Group at at ime
    3. One can define which resources can be accessed by the users in the Delivery Group
* To deliver different applications to different users:
    1. Install all the applications on the master image for one machine catalog
    2. Create enough machines in that catalog to distribute among several delivery groups

## Within Citrix Environment
* Ideal approach to deploy AAE is within the Citrix Environment
* Operation and montioring in AAE is performed over ```Independent Computing Architecture (ICA)```
* Direct access to all enterprise systems necessary for business process automation care provided to the Bot Creators, Bot runners, and Control Room
* Leverage on all available AAE Client features and commands
* While a bot may be monitored remotely over ICA , if the session drops, the bot continues to run within the intranet
* Better network performance within the intranet
* Better security as data processed by the Bot remains within the intranet on systems owned by the enterprise
